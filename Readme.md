# A non-fully featured parser and a small langage written in Haskell 

## Note
If you look closely at the code, it may seem similar to the parsec library: it is because it is, while being simpler than parsec

## TODO: 
- Print in a better way, `Show` instance should not be used, it can't output Ã‚ for instance (use a custom class for printing)
